					<h1>Fast Food Campaign</h1>	
					<h2>Ongoing</h2>
					<div class="write-up">
						<p>TBI helped launch one the nation’s most successful economic justice campaigns – the fast food campaign. In 2012, when the campaign first began in New York City, TBI partnered with New York Communities for Change to hold meetings in boroughs across NYC with majority black clergy and fast food workers. Workers shared their stories of low pay and little respect at the workplace and the stories mirrored the issues faced by thousands in the clergy’s congregations- most of whom lived below the poverty line.  After hearing these stories, the clergy quickly identified poverty wages in the fast food industry as an issue they wanted to work on.</p>
